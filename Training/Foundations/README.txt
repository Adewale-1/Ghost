    https://cse.osu.edu/computing-services/resources/remote-access

    Once you're in the linux environment, 
    1. Open a terminal window.
    2. On the command line, navigate to the location of your code files (using the 'cd' command)

    Run 'subscribe JDK-CURRENT' to set your java version. You need to do this step only once.
        
        To run Java code going forward:
        3. Compile all java files with 'javac *.java'.
            You should see <name>.class files appear in the directory.
        4. Run your main class with 'java classname'.
            'java demo' will run the demo.
