        My greatest strengths include the ability to be able to quickly fit into any team, I am
        more flexible which mean I can adapts to any environment and I can diverse my area of 
        expartise quickly. I will always take ownership of difficult challenges to achieve a

        I do not enjoy giving people honest feedback objectively
        Find it difficult to let go of project









As a Lead Software Developer in a Start-Up, a recent  challenge  I faced was how to enhance
student engagement and learning outcomes through an educational application. 

The core issue was making the learning material more interactive.and my solution involved
leveraging my expertise in Python and object-oriented programming and design to integrate an innovative features such as :
Flashcard generation from textbooks, adaptive and functional learning.all  This was achieved by employing
HuggingFace models, OpenAI Embeddings, and Langchain’s Vector stores. 
 
This approach not only improved the functionality and user experience
of the application but also directly addressed the problem by providing a more engaging and functional
learning tool. With this approach, I was able to significantly boost student
engagement and learning outcomes.

Describe what a class is

In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template used to create objects.
It defines the properties (attributes) that an object will have and the behaviors (methods) that
the object can perform.

What is thread safety (in Java)?

Thread safety in Java refers to the ability of code to run correctly and produce consistent results
in a multithreaded environment. This means that multiple threads can access and manipulate shared
data without causing unpredictable behavior or errors.

Why do we need to use inheritance(extends) when we can call a method directly like class.method()
Code reuseablity
