With infinite\ncomplacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs,\nserene in their assurance of their empire over matter .

No one gave a thought to the\nolder worlds of space as sources  of human danger , or thought of them only\nto dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or impro bable. It is\ncurious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most\nterrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps\ninferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet\nacross the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of\nthe beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded\nthis earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against\nus.

And early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment.\nThe planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader , revolves about the\nsun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it\nreceives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world. It must\nbe, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our world; and long\nbefore this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface must  have begun\nits course.

Its air is much\nmore attenuated than ours, its oceans have shrunk until they cover but a\nthird of its surface, and as its slow seasons change huge snowcaps gather\nand melt about either pole and periodically inundate its temperate zones.\nThat last stage of exhaustion, which to us is still incredibly remote, has\nbecome a present-day problem for the inhabitants of Mars.

The immediate\npressure of necessity has bright ened their intellects, enlar ged their powers,\nand hardened their hearts.

The\nintellectual side of man already  admits that life is an incessant struggle for\nexistence, and it would seem that this too is the belief of the minds upon\nMars. Their world is far gone in its cooling and this world is still crowded\nwith life, but crowded only with what they regard as inferior animals. To\ncarry warfare sunward is, indeed, their only escape from the destruction\nthat, generation after generation, creeps upon them.\nAnd before we judge of them  too harshly we must remember what\nruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon\nanimals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its inferior', 'ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon\nanimals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its inferior\nraces. The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely sweptout of existence  in a war of extermination waged by European immigrants,\nin the space of fifty years. Are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if\nthe Martians warred in the same spirit?\nThe Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing\nsubtlety—their mathematical learning is evidently far in exces s of ours—\nand to have carried out their preparations with a well-nigh perfect\nunanimity .

All that time the\nMartians must have been getting ready .\nDuring the oppo sition of 1894 a great light was seen on the illuminated\npart of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory , then by Perrotin of Nice, and\nthen by other observers. English readers heard of it first in the issue of\nNatur e dated August 2.

I am inclined to think that this blaze may have been\nthe casting of the huge gun, in the vast pit sunk into their planet, from\nwhich their shots were fired at us. Peculiar markings, as yet unexplained,\nwere seen near the site of that outbreak during the next two oppositions.\nThe storm burst upon us six years ago now. As Mars approached\nopposition, Lavelle of Java set the wires of the astronomica l exchange\npalpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of\nincandescent gas upon the plane t. It had occurred towards midnight of the\ntwelfth; and the spectroscope, to which he had at once resorted, indicated a\nmass of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving with an enormous velocity\ntowards this earth.

This jet of fire had become invisible about a quarter past\ntwelve. He compared it to a colossal puff of flame suddenly and violently\nsquirted out of the planet, “as flaming gases rushed out of a gun.”\nA singu larly appropriate phrase  it proved. Yet the next day there was\nnothing of this in the papers except a little note in the Daily Telegraph , and\nthe world went in ignorance of one of the gravest dangers that ever\nthreatened the human race. I might not have heard of the eruption at all had\nI not met Ogilvy , the well-known astronomer , at Ottershaw .

He was\nimmensely excit ed at the news, and in the excess of his feelings invited me\nup to take a turn with him that night in a scrutiny of the red planet.In spite of all that has happened since, I still remember that vigil very\ndistinctly: the black and silent observatory , the shadowed lantern  throwing a\nfeeble glow upon the floor in the corner , the steady ticking of the clockwork\nof the telescope , the little slit in the roof—an oblong profund ity with the\nstardust streaked across it. Ogilvy moved about, invisible but audible.\nLooking through  the telescope, one saw a circle of deep blue and the little\nround planet swimming in the field.

It seemed such a little thing, so bright\nand small and still, faintly marked with transverse stripes, and slightly\nflattened from the perfect round. But so little it was, so silvery warm—a\npin’s head of light! It was as if it quivered, but really this was the telescope\nvibrating with the activity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view .\nAs I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to\nadvance and recede, but that was simply that my eye was tired. Forty\nmillions of miles it was from us—more than forty millions of miles of void.\nFew people realise the immen sity of vacancy in which the dust of the\nmaterial universe swims.', 'millions of miles it was from us—more than forty millions of miles of void.\nFew people realise the immen sity of vacancy in which the dust of the\nmaterial universe swims.\nNear it in the field, I remember , were three faint points of light, three\ntelescopic stars infinitely remot e, and all around it was the unfathomable\ndarkness of empty space. You know how that blackness looks  on a frosty\nstarlight night. In a telescope it seems far profounder . And invisible to me\nbecause it was so remote and small, flying swiftly and steadily towards me\nacross that incredible distance, drawing nearer every minute by so many\nthousands of miles, came the Thing they were sending us, the Thing that\nwas to bring so much struggle and calamity and death to the earth. I never', 'thousands of miles, came the Thing they were sending us, the Thing that\nwas to bring so much struggle and calamity and death to the earth. I never\ndreamed of it then as I watched; no one on earth dreamed of that unerring\nmissile.\nThat night, too, there was another jetting out of gas from the distant\nplanet. I saw it. A reddish flash  at the edge, the slightest projection of the\noutline just as the chronometer struck midnight; and at that I told Ogilvy\nand he took my place. The night was warm and I was thirsty , and I went\nstretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the darkness, to the little\ntable where the siphon stood, while Ogilvy exclaimed at the streamer of gas\nthat came out towards us.\nThat night anoth er invisible missile started on its way to the earth from', 'table where the siphon stood, while Ogilvy exclaimed at the streamer of gas\nthat came out towards us.\nThat night anoth er invisible missile started on its way to the earth from\nMars, just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the first one. I\nremember how I sat on the table there in the blackness, with patches ofgreen and crimson swimming before my eyes. I wished I had a light to\nsmoke by, little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam I had seen and\nall that it would presently bring me. Ogilvy watched till one, and then gave\nit up; and we lit the lantern and walked over to his house.

He pointed out to\nme how unlikely it was that organic evolution had taken the same direction\nin the two adjacent planets.\n“The chances against anything manlike on Mars are a million to one,” he\nsaid.\nHundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after about\nmidnight, and again the night after; and so for ten nights, a flame each\nnight.

Dense clouds of smoke or dust, visible through a powerful\ntelescope on earth as little grey, fluctuating patches, spread through the\nclearness of the planet’ s atmosphere and obscured its more familiar\nfeatures.\nEven the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last, and popular\nnotes appeared here, there, and everywhere concerning the volcanoes upon\nMars.

And, all unsuspected, those missiles the Martians\nhad fired at us drew earthward, rushing now at a pace of many miles a\nsecond through the empty gulf of space, hour by hour and day by day,\nnearer and nearer . It seems to me now almost incredibly wonderful that,\nwith that swift fate hanging over us, men could go about their petty\nconcerns as they did. I remember how jubilant Markham was at securing a\nnew photograph of the planet for the illustrated paper he edited in those\ndays.

For my own part, I was much\noccupied in learning to ride the bicycle, and busy upon a series of papersdiscussing the probable developments of moral ideas as civilisation\nprogressed.\nOne night (the first missile then could scarcely have been 10,000,000\nmiles away) I went for a walk with my wife. It was starlight and I explained\nthe Signs of the Zodiac to her, and pointed out Mars, a bright dot of light\ncreeping zenithw ard, towards which so many telescopes were pointed.

From  the railway\nstation in the distance came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and\nrumbling, softened almost into melody by the distance. My wife pointed out\nto me the brightness of the red, green, and yellow signal lights hanging in a\nframework against the sky . It seemed so safe and tranquil.II.\nTHE FALLING STAR.\nThen came the night of the first falling star. It was seen early in the\nmorning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in the\natmosphere.

Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for an ordinary falling\nstar. Albin described it as leavin g a greenish streak behind it that glowed for\nsome seconds. Denning, our greatest authority on meteorites, stated that the\nheight of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles. It\nseemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him.\nI was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although my\nFrench windows face towards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I loved\nin those days to look up at the night sky), I saw nothing of it.

Yet this\nstrangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space must have\nfallen while I was sitting there , visible to me had I only looked up as it\npassed. Some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing\nsound. I myself heard nothing of that. Many people in Berkshire, Surrey ,\nand Middlesex must have seen the fall of it, and, at most, have thought that\nanother meteorit e had descended. No one seems to have troubled to look for\nthe fallen mass that night.\nBut very early in the morning poor Ogilvy , who had seen the shooting\nstar and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere on the common\nbetween Horsell, Ottershaw , and Woking, rose early with the idea of finding', 'star and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere on the common\nbetween Horsell, Ottershaw , and Woking, rose early with the idea of finding\nit. Find it he did, soon after dawn, and not far from the sand-pits. An\nenormous hole had been made by the impact of the projectile, and the sand\nand gravel had been flung violently in every direction over the heath,\nforming heaps visible a mile and a half away . The heather was on fire\neastward, and a thin blue smoke rose against the dawn.\nThe Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand, amidst the scattered\nsplinters of a fir tree it had shivered to fragments in its descent.

It had a', 'outline softened  by a thick scaly dun-coloured incrustation . It had a\ndiameter of about thirty yards. He approached the mass, surprised at the\nsize and more so at the shape, since most meteorites are rounded more or\nless completely . It was, howeve r, still so hot from its flight through the air\nas to forbid his near approach. A stirring noise within its cylinder he\nascribed to the unequal cooling of its surface; for at that time it had not\noccurred to him that it might be hollow .\nHe remained standing at the edge of the pit that the Thing had made for\nitself, staring at its strange appearance, astonished chiefly at its unusual\nshape and colour , and dimly perceiving even then some evidence of design\nin its arrival.

He did not\nremember heari ng any birds that morning, there was certainly no breeze\nstirring, and the only sounds were the faint movements from  within the\ncindery cylinder . He was all alone on the common.\nThen suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the grey clinker , the\nashy incrustatio n that covered the meteorite, was falling off the circular\nedge of the end.

It was droppin g off in flakes and raining down upon the\nsand. A large piece suddenly came off and fell with a sharp noise that\nbrought his heart into his mouth.\nFor a minute he scarcely realised what this meant, and, although the heat\nwas excessive, he clambered down into the pit close to the bulk to see the\nThing more clearly . He fancied even then that the cooling of the body might\naccount for this, but what disturbed that idea was the fact that the ash was\nfalling only from the end of the cylinder .\nAnd then he perceived that, very slowly , the circular top of the cylinder\nwas rotating on its body . It was such a gradual movement that he discovered\nit only through noticing that a black mark that had been near him five', 'was rotating on its body . It was such a gradual movement that he discovered\nit only through noticing that a black mark that had been near him five\nminutes ago was now at the other side of the circumference. Even then he\nscarcely underst ood what this indicated, until he heard a muffled grating\nsound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so. Then the thing\ncame upon him in a flash. The cylinder was artificial—hollo w—with an\nend that screwed out! Something within the cylinder was unscrewing the\ntop!“Good heavens!” said Ogilvy . “There’ s a man in it—men in it! Half\nroasted to death! T rying to escape!”\nAt once, with a quick mental leap, he linked the Thing with the flash\nupon Mars.\nThe thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to him that he', 'roasted to death! T rying to escape!”\nAt once, with a quick mental leap, he linked the Thing with the flash\nupon Mars.\nThe thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to him that he\nforgot the heat and went forward  to the cylinder to help turn. But luckily the\ndull radiation arrested him before he could burn his hands on the still-\nglowing metal. At that he stood irresolute for a moment, then turned,\nscrambled out of the pit, and set off running wildly into Woking. The time\nthen must have been somewhere  about six o’clock. He met a waggoner and\ntried to make him understand, but the tale he told and his appearance were\nso wild—his hat had fallen off in the pit—that the man simply drove on. He\nwas equally unsuccessful with the potman who was just unlocking the doors', 'so wild—his hat had fallen off in the pit—that the man simply drove on. He\nwas equally unsuccessful with the potman who was just unlocking the doors\nof the public-house by Horsell Bridge. The fellow thought he was a lunatic\nat large and made an unsuccessful attempt to shut him into the taproom.\nThat sobered him a little; and when he saw Henderson, the London\njournalist, in his garden, he called over the palings and made himself\nunderstood.\n“Henderson,” he called, “you saw that shooting star last night?”\n“Well?” said Henderson.\n“It’s out on Horsell Common now .”\n“Good Lord!” said Henderson. “Fallen meteorite! That’ s good.”\n“But it’s something more than a meteorite. It’s a cylinder—an artificial\ncylinder , man!

Henderson was a minute or so\ntaking it in. Then he dropped his spade, snatched up his jacket, and came\nout into the road. The two men hurried back at once to the common, and\nfound the cylinder still lying in the same position. But now the sounds\ninside had cease d, and a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top\nand the body of the cylinder .

I heard of it first from my newspaper boy about a\nquarter to nine when I went out to get my Daily Chronicle . I was naturally\nstartled, and lost no time in going out and across the Ottershaw bridge to the\nsand-pits.III.\nON HORSELL COMMON.\nI found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding the huge hole\nin which the cylinder lay.

No doubt its impact had caused a flash\nof fire. Henderson and Ogilvy were not there.

There was very little talking. Few of the common\npeople in England had anything  but the vaguest astronomical ideas in those\ndays. Most of them were staring quietly at the big table like end of the\ncylinder , which was still as Ogilvy and Henderson had left it.

Some went away while I was there, and other people came.\nI clambered into the pit and fancied I heard a faint movement under my\nfeet. The top had certainly ceased to rotate.\nIt was only when I got thus close to it that the strangeness of this object\nwas at all evide nt to me. At the first glance it was really no more exciting\nthan an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road. Not so much so,\nindeed. It looked like a rusty gas float. It required a certain amount of\nscientific educa tion to perceive that the grey scale of the Thing was nocommon oxide, that the yellowish-white metal that gleamed in the crack\nbetween the lid and the cylinder had an unfamiliar hue. “Extra-terrestrial”', 'between the lid and the cylinder had an unfamiliar hue. “Extra-terrestrial”\nhad no meaning for most of the onlookers.\nAt that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the Thing had come\nfrom the planet Mars, but I judged it improbable that it containe d any living\ncreature. I thought the unscrewi ng might be automatic. In spite of Ogilvy , I\nstill believed that there were men in Mars. My mind ran fancifully on the\npossibilities of its containing manuscript, on the difficulties in translation\nthat might arise, whether we should find coins and models in it, and so\nforth. Yet it was a little too large for assurance on this idea. I felt an\nimpatience to see it opened.

Strange imaginings passed through my mind. As I drew\nnearer I heard Stent’ s voice:\n“Keep back!

What could be going on there?\nMost of the spectators had gathered in one or two groups—one a little\ncrowd towards Woking, the other a knot of people in the direction of\nChobham.

There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.\nIt was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I suppose\nthe new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confiden ce.

I staggered through the trees, fell into a ditch and bruised\nmy knees against a plank, and finally splashed out into the lane that ran\ndown from the College Arms.  I say splashed, for the storm water was\nsweeping the sand down the hill in a muddy torrent.

Across the light huge black\nshapes, grotesque and strange, moved busily to and fro.\nIt seeme d indeed as if the whole country in that direction was on fire—a\nbroad hillside set with minute tongues of flame, swaying and writhing with\nthe gusts of the dying storm, and throwing a red reflection upon the cloud', 'broad hillside set with minute tongues of flame, swaying and writhing with\nthe gusts of the dying storm, and throwing a red reflection upon the cloud\nscud above.

There was a light down below the hill, on the railw ay, near the\narch, and several of the houses along the Maybury road and the streets near\nthe station were glowing ruins. The light upon the railway puzzled me at\nfirst; there were a black heap and a vivid glare, and to the right of that a row\nof yellow  oblongs.

At first I\ncould distinguish  no people at all, though I peered intently for them.

As the limber gunners went to the rear, his horse\ntrod in a rabbit hole and came down, throwing him into a depre ssion of the\nground. At the same moment the gun exploded behind him, the ammunitionblew up, there was fire all about him, and he found himself lying under a\nheap of charred dead men and dead horses.\n“I lay still,” he said, “scared out of my wits, with the fore quarter of a\nhorse atop of me.

Just like parade it had been a minu te before—\nthen stumble, bang, swish!”\n“Wiped out!” he said.\nHe had hid under the dead horse for a long time, peeping out furtively\nacross the common. The Cardigan men had tried a rush, in skirmishing\norder , at the pit, simply to be swept out of existence. Then the monster had\nrisen to its feet and had begun to walk leisurely to and fro across the\ncommon among the few fugitives, with its headlike hood turning about\nexactly like the head of a cowled human being.

At last, afternightfall, the artilleryman made a rush for it and got over the railway\nembankment.\nSince then he had been skulking along towards Maybury , in the hope of\ngetting out of danger Londonward.

He made me ransack the house for a\nflask, which he filled with whisky; and we lined every available pocket with\npackets of biscuits and slices of meat. Then we crept out of the house, and\nran as quickly as we could down the ill-made road by which I had come\novernight. The houses seemed deserted.

We\npushed through  these towards the railway without meeting a soul.

The morning papers on\nSaturday contained, in addition  to lengthy special articles on the planet\nMars, on life in the planets, and so forth, a brief and vagu ely worded\ntelegram, all the more striking for its brevity .\nThe Martians, alarmed by the approach of a crowd, had killed a number\nof people with a quick-firing gun, so the story ran. The telegram concluded\nwith the words:  “Formidable as they seem to be, the Martians have not\nmoved from the pit into which they have fallen, and, indeed, seem\nincapable of doing so.

People who have never seen these structures, and have only the\nill-imagined efforts of artists or the imperfect descriptions of such eye-\nwitnesses as myself to go upon, scarcely realise that living quality .\nI recall particularly the illustrati on of one of the first pamphlets to give a\nconsecutive account of the war. The artist had evidently made a hasty study\nof one of the fighting-machin es, and there his knowledge ended.

The pamphlet\ncontaining these renderings had a considerable vogue, and I mention them\nhere simply to warn the reade r against the impression they may have\ncreated. They were no more like the Martians I saw in action than a Dutch\ndoll is like a human being. To my mind, the pamphlet would have been\nmuch better without them.\nAt first, I say, the handling-mach ine did not impress me as a machine, but\nas a crablike creature with a glittering integument, the controlling Martian\nwhose delicate tentacles actuate d its movements seeming to be simply the\nequivalent of the crab’ s cerebral portion.

With that realisation my interest shifted to\nthose other creatures, the real Martians. Already I had had a transient\nimpression of these, and the first nausea no longer obscured my\nobservation. Moreover , I was concealed and motionless, and under no\nurgency of action.\nThey were, I now saw, the most unearthly creatures it is possible to\nconceive.

They were huge round  bodies—or , rather , heads—about four feet\nin diameter , each body having in front of it a face. This face had no nostrils\n—indeed, the Martians do not seem to have had any sense of smell, but it\nhad a pair of very large dark-coloured eyes, and just beneath this a kind of\nfleshy beak. In the back of this head or body—I scarcely know how to\nspeak of it—was the single tight tympanic surface, since known to be\nanatomically an ear, though it must have been almost useless in our dense\nair. In a group round the mouth were sixteen slender , almost whiplike\ntentacles, arrang ed in two bunches of eight each. These bunches have since\nbeen named rather aptly , by that distinguished anatomist, Professor Howes,', 'tentacles, arrang ed in two bunches of eight each. These bunches have since\nbeen named rather aptly , by that distinguished anatomist, Professor Howes,\nthe hands . Even as I saw these Martians for the first time they seemed to be\nendeavouring to raise themselves on these hands, but of course, with the\nincreased weigh t of terrestrial conditions, this was impossible. There is\nreason to suppose that on Mars they may have progressed upon them with\nsome facility .\nThe internal anatomy , I may remark here, as dissection has since shown,\nwas almost equally simple. The greater part of the structure was the brain,sending enormo us nerves to the eyes, ear, and tactile tentacles. Besides this\nwere the bulky lungs, into whic h the mouth opened, and the heart and its', 'were the bulky lungs, into whic h the mouth opened, and the heart and its\nvessels. The pulmonary distress caused by the denser atmosphere and\ngreater gravitational attraction was only too evident in the convulsive\nmovements of the outer skin.\nAnd this was the sum of the Martian organs. Strange as it may seem to a\nhuman being, all the complex apparatus of digestion, which makes up the\nbulk of our bodies, did not exist  in the Martians. They were heads—merely\nheads. Entrails they had none. They did not eat, much less digest. Instead,\nthey took the fresh, living blood of other creatures, and injected  it into their\nown veins. I have myself seen this being done, as I shall mention in its\nplace. But, squeamish as I may seem, I cannot bring myself to describe', 'own veins.

Let it suffice to say,\nblood obtained from a still living animal, in most cases from a human\nbeing, was run directly by means of a little pipette into the recipient canal. .\n. .\nThe bare idea of this is no doubt horribly repulsive to us, but at the same\ntime I think that we should reme mber how repulsive our carnivorous habits\nwould seem to an intelligent rabbit.\nThe physiological advantages of the practice of injection are undeniable,\nif one thinks of the tremendous waste of human time and energy occasioned\nby eating and the digestive process.

Men go happy or miserable as they have\nhealthy or unhealthy livers, or sound gastric glands. But the Martians were\nlifted above all these or ganic fluctuations of mood and emotion.\nTheir undeniable preference for men as their source of nourishment is\npartly explained  by the nature  of the remains of the victims they had\nbrought with them as provisions  from Mars. These creatures, to judge from\nthe shrivelled remains that have fallen into human hands, were bipeds with', 'brought with them as provisions  from Mars. These creatures, to judge from\nthe shrivelled remains that have fallen into human hands, were bipeds with\nflimsy , silicious  skeletons (almost like those of the silicious sponges) and\nfeeble musculat ure, standing about six feet high and having round, erect\nheads, and large eyes in flinty sockets. Two or three of these seem to have\nbeen brought in each cylinder , and all were killed before earth was reached.It was just as well for them, for the mere attempt to stand upright upon our\nplanet would have broken every bone in their bodies.\nAnd while I am engaged in this description, I may add in this place\ncertain further details which, although they were not all evident to us at the', 'planet would have broken every bone in their bodies.\nAnd while I am engaged in this description, I may add in this place\ncertain further details which, although they were not all evident to us at the\ntime, will enable the reader who is unacquainted with them  to form a\nclearer picture of these of fensive creatures.\nIn three other points their physiology differed strangely from ours. Their\norganisms did not sleep, any more than the heart of man sleeps. Since they\nhad no extensive muscular mechanism to recuperate, that periodical\nextinction was unknown to them . They had little or no sense of fatigue, it\nwould seem. On earth they could  never have moved without effort, yet even\nto the last they kept in action.

In twenty-four hours they did twenty-four\nhours of work, as even on earth is perhaps the case with the ants.\nIn the next place, wonderful as it seems in a sexual world, the Martians\nwere absolutely  without sex, and therefore without any of the tumultuous\nemotions that arise from that difference among men. A young Martian,\nthere can now be no dispute, was really born upon earth during the war, and\nit was found attached to its parent, partially budded  off, just as young\nlilybulbs bud of f, or like the young animals in the fresh-water polyp.\nIn man, in all the higher terrestrial animals, such a method of increase has', 'lilybulbs bud of f, or like the young animals in the fresh-water polyp.\nIn man, in all the higher terrestrial animals, such a method of increase has\ndisappeared; but even on this earth it was certainly the primit ive method.\nAmong the lower animals, up even to those first cousins of the vertebrated\nanimals, the Tunicates, the two processes occur side by side, but finally the\nsexual method superseded its competitor altogether . On Mars, however , just\nthe reverse has apparently been the case.\nIt is worthy of remark that a certain speculative writer of quasi- scientific\nrepute, writing long before the Martian invasion, did forecast for man a\nfinal structure not unlike the actual Martian condition. His prophecy , I\nremember , appe ared in November or December , 1893, in a long-defunct', 'final structure not unlike the actual Martian condition. His prophecy , I\nremember , appe ared in November or December , 1893, in a long-defunct\npublication, the Pall Mall Budget , and I recall a caricature of it in a pre-\nMartian periodical called Punch . He pointed out—writing in a foolish,\nfacetious tone— that the perfection of mechanical appliances must\nultimately supersede limbs; the perfection of chemical devices, digestion;\nthat such organs as hair, external nose, teeth, ears, and chin were no longer\nessential parts of the human being, and that the tendency  of natural\nselection would  lie in the direction of their steady diminution through thecoming ages.

To me it is quite credible\nthat the Martians may be descended from beings not unlike ourselves, by a\ngradual develop ment of brain and hands (the latter giving rise to the two\nbunches of delicate tentacles at last) at the expense of the rest of the body .', 'gradual develop ment of brain and hands (the latter giving rise to the two\nbunches of delicate tentacles at last) at the expense of the rest of the body .\nWithout the body the brain would, of course, become a mere selfish\nintelligence, without any of the emotional substratum of the human being.\nThe last salient point in which  the systems of these creatures  differed\nfrom ours was in what one might have thought a very trivia l particular .\nMicro-or ganisms, which cause so much disease and pain on earth, have\neither never appeared upon Mars or Martian sanitary science eliminated\nthem ages ago.

And speaking of the differences between  the life on\nMars and terrestrial life, I may allude here to the curious sugges tions of the\nred weed.\nApparently the vegetable kingdom in Mars, instead of having green for a\ndominant colour , is of a vivid blood-red tint. At any rate, the seeds which\nthe Martians (intentionally or accidentally) brought with them gave rise in\nall cases to red-coloured growths. Only that known popularly as the red\nweed, however , gained any footing in competition with terrestrial forms.\nThe red creeper was quite a transitory growth, and few people have seen it', 'weed, however , gained any footing in competition with terrestrial forms.\nThe red creeper was quite a transitory growth, and few people have seen it\ngrowing.

Now no\nsurviving human being saw so much of the Martians in action as I did. I\ntake no credit to myself for an accident, but the fact is so.

Their conceptions of ornament and\ndecorum were necessarily different from ours; and not only were they\nevidently much less sensible of changes of temperature than we are, but\nchanges of pressure do not seem to have affected their health at all\nseriously .

They have become  practically\nmere brains, wearing different bodies according to their needs just as men\nwear suits of clothes and take a bicycle in a hurry or an umbrella in the wet.\nAnd of their appliances, perhap s nothing is more wonderful to a man than\nthe curious fact that what is the dominant feature of almost all human', 'And of their appliances, perhap s nothing is more wonderful to a man than\nthe curious fact that what is the dominant feature of almost all human\ndevices in mechanism is absent —the wheel  is absen t; amon g all the things\nthey brought to earth there is no trace or suggestion of their use of wheels.\nOne would have at least expecte d it in locomotion. And in this connection it\nis curious to remark that even on this earth Nature has never hit upon the\nwheel, or has preferred other expedients to its development.

It seemed\ninfinitely more alive than the actual Martians lying beyond it in the sunset\nlight, panting, stirring ineffectual tentacles, and moving feebly after their\nvast journey across space.\nWhile I was still watching their sluggish motions in the sunlight, and\nnoting each strange detail of their form, the curate reminded  me of his\npresence by pulling violently at my arm.

At a later date we began to feel less in\ndanger of their eyes, for to an eye in the dazzle of the sunlight outside our\nrefuge must have been blank blackness, but at first the slightest suggestion\nof approach drove us into the scullery in heart-throbbing retreat.

Let me return to those first new\nexperiences of mine. After a long time I ventured back to the peephole, to\nfind that the new-comers had been reinforced by the occupants of no fewer\nthan three of the fighting-machines.

With two spatulate hands the handling-m achine was\ndigging out and flinging masses of clay into the pear-shaped receptacle\nabove, while with another arm it periodically opened a door and removed\nrusty and blackened clinkers from the middle part of the machine. Another', 'above, while with another arm it periodically opened a door and removed\nrusty and blackened clinkers from the middle part of the machine.

From this unseen receiver a little thread of green smoke rose verticallyinto the quiet air. As I looked , the handling-machine, with a faint and\nmusical clinking, extended, telescopic fashion, a tentacle that had been a\nmoment before a mere blunt projection, until its end was hidden behind the\nmound of clay.

He came sliding down the rubbish and crept\nbeside me in the darkness, inarticulate, gesticulating, and for a moment I\nshared his panic.

The sprawling\nMartians were no longer to be seen, the mound of blue-green powder had\nrisen to cover them from sight, and a fighting-machine, with its legs\ncontracted, crumpled, and abbreviated, stood across the corner of the pit.\nAnd then, amid the clangour of the machinery , came a drifting suspicion of\nhuman voices, that I entertained at first only to dismiss.', 'And then, amid the clangour of the machinery , came a drifting suspicion of\nhuman voices, that I entertained at first only to dismiss.\nI crouched, watching this fighting-machine closely , satisfying myself\nnow for the first time that the hood did indeed contain a Martian.

And sudd enly I heard a yell, and saw a long tentacle\nreaching over the shoulder of the machine to the little cage that hunchedupon its back.

I could see his staring eyes and\ngleams of light on his studs and watch chain. He vanished behind the\nmound, and for a moment there was silence. And then began a shrieking\nand a sustained and cheerful hooting from the Martians.\nI slid down the rubbish, struggled to my feet, clapped my hands  over my\nears, and bolted into the scull ery.

Our chief chance lay in the\npossibility of the Martians making the pit nothing more than a temporary\nencampment. Or even if they kept it permanently , they might not consider it\nnecessary to guard it, and a chance of escape might be afforded us. I also\nweighed very carefully the possibility of our digging a way out in a\ndirection away from the pit, but the chances of our emer ging within sight of\nsome sentinel fighting-machine seemed at first too great.

It was the only occasion on which I actually saw the Martians feed.\nAfter that experience I avoided the hole in the wall for the better part of a\nday.

In the\ndirection away from the pit I saw, beyond a red-covered wall, a patch of\ngarden ground unburied. This gave me a hint, and I went knee-deep, and\nsometimes neck-deep, in the red weed. The density of the weed gave me a\nreassuring sense of hiding. The wall was some six feet high, and when I\nattempted to clamber it I found I could not lift my feet to the crest.

The matter he\nprinted was emotional; the news organisation had not as yet found its way\nback. I learned nothing fresh except that already in one week the\nexamination of the Martian mechanisms had yielded astonishing results.\nAmong other things, the article assured me what I did not believe at the\ntime, that the “Secret of Flying,” was discovered.

And\njust outside the terminus the train jolted over temporary rails, and on either\nside of the railway the houses were blackened ruins.

Walton, by virtue of its\nunburned pine woods, seemed the least hurt of any place along the line. The\nWandle, the Mole, every little stream, was a heaped mass of red weed, in\nappearance between butcher ’s meat and pickled cabbage.

My knowledge of\ncomparative physiology is confined to a book or two, but it seems to me\nthat Carver ’s suggestions as to the reason of the rapid death of the Martians\nis so probable as to be regard ed almost as a proven conclus ion. I have\nassumed that in the body of my narrative.\nAt any rate, in all the bodies of the Martians that were examined  after the\nwar, no bacteria except those already known as terrestrial species were\nfound.

That they did not bury any of their dead, and the reckless slaughter\nthey perpetrated, point also to an entire ignorance of the putrefactive\nprocess. But probable as this seems, it is by no means a proven conclusion.\nNeither is the composition of the Black Smoke known, which the\nMartians used with such deadly effect, and the generator of the Heat-Rays\nremains a puzzle. The terrible disasters at the Ealing and South Kensington\nlaboratories have disinclined analysts for further investigations upon the\nlatter . Spectrum analysis of the black powder points unmistakably to the\npresence of an unknown element with a brilliant group of three lines in the\ngreen, and it is possible that it combines with argon to form a compound', 'presence of an unknown element with a brilliant group of three lines in the\ngreen, and it is possible that it combines with argon to form a compound\nwhich acts at once with deadly effect upon some constituent in the blood.\nBut such unproven speculations will scarcely be of interest to the general\nreader , to whom this story is addressed. None of the brown scum that\ndrifted down the Thames after the destruction of Shepperton was examined\nat the time, and now none is forthcoming.\nThe results of an anatomical examination of the Martians, so far as the\nprowling dogs had left such an examination possible, I have already given.But everyone is familiar with the magnificent and almost complete\nspecimen in spirits at the Natural History Museum, and the countless', 'specimen in spirits at the Natural History Museum, and the countless\ndrawings that have been made from it; and beyond that the interest of their\nphysiology and structure is purely scientific.\nA quest ion of graver and unive rsal interest is the possibility of another\nattack from the Martians. I do not think that nearly enough attention is\nbeing given to this aspect of the matter . At present the planet  Mars is in\nconjunction, but with every return to opposition I, for one, anticipate a\nrenewal of their adventure. In any case, we should be prepared. It seems to\nme that it shoul d be possible to define the position of the gun from which\nthe shots are dischar ged, to keep a sustained watch upon this part of the\nplanet, and to anticipate the arrival of the next attack.', 'the shots are dischar ged, to keep a sustained watch upon this part of the\nplanet, and to anticipate the arrival of the next attack.\nIn that case the cylinder might be destroyed with dynamite or artillery\nbefore it was sufficiently cool for the Martians to emer ge, or they might be\nbutchered by means of guns so soon as the screw opened. It seems to me\nthat they have lost a vast adva ntage in the failure of their first surprise.\nPossibly they see it in the same light.\nLessing has advanced excellent reasons for supposing that the Martians\nhave actually succeeded in effecting a landing on the planet Venus.

Subseque ntly a peculiar luminous and sinuous marking appeared on\nthe unillumined half of the inner planet, and almost simultaneously a faint\ndark mark of a similar sinuous character was detected upon a photograph of\nthe Martian disk. One needs to see the drawings of these appearances in\norder to appreciate fully their remarkable resemblance in character .\nAt any rate, whether we expect another invasion or not, our views of the\nhuman future must be greatly modified by these events.

It may be that across the immensity of space theMartians have watched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their\nlesson, and that on the planet Venus they have found a securer settlement.', 'lesson, and that on the planet Venus they have found a securer settlement.\nBe that as it may, for many years yet there will certainly be no relaxation of\nthe eager scrutiny of the Martian disk, and those fiery darts of the sky, the\nshooting stars, will bring with them as they fall an unavoidable\napprehension to all the sons of men.\nThe broadening  of men’ s views that has resulted can scarcely be\nexaggerated. Before the cylinde r fell there was a general persuasion that\nthrough all the deep of space no life existed beyond the petty surface of our\nminute sphere. Now we see further . If the Martians can reach Venus, there\nis no reason to suppose that the thing is impossible for men, and when the\nslow cooling of the sun makes this earth uninhabitable, as at last it must do,', 'is no reason to suppose that the thing is impossible for men, and when the\nslow cooling of the sun makes this earth uninhabitable, as at last it must do,\nit may be that the thread of life that has begun here will have streamed out\nand caught our sister planet within its toils.\nDim and wonderful is the visio n I have conjured up in my mind of life\nspreading slowly from this little seed bed of the solar system throughout the\ninanimate vastness of sidereal space. But that is a remote dream. It may be,\non the other hand, that the destruction of the Martians is only a reprieve.
